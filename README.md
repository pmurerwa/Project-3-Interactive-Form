//Contextual Error Messages for Form Validation
    // The form offers contextual error messages for certain - fields to provide users with more relevant feedback, depending on the type of error encountered.

//Contextual Error Messages for the "Email Address" Field
    //These Error Messages provide distinct error messages based on the type of validation failure:
    //If the field is empty, the message prompts the user to enter an email address.
    //If the email format is invalid, the message instructs the user to correct the format (e.g., by providing an example like brian@teamtreehouse.com).
    //This approach provides users with more meaningful feedback, which helps them correct specific issues more easily.
